User Friendly Graphical User Interface for Pen testing (EDUPEN)

Supervisor: Kimberly Tam

Project Vision

The product that I am making is a User-Friendly GUI for Penetration Testing. The purpose of the product is to make pen testing tools more accessible to beginners. 
This is important because it will entice more people to learn how to pen test. The target demographic intended to use the product is within the education 
industry (universities and colleges), Any size business that wants to test their security for their company and new or inexperienced pen testers.

The current issue with pen testing tools is that the user needs to already be educated in command line code. The tools can be confusing for inexperienced pen 
testers due to the lack of an intuitive graphical user interface design. This is an issue because it can put off potential new users from trying to learn pen 
testing tools. This is unfortunate in an era that is in high demand for pen testers as security should be a top priority for businesses and organisations. 
It is also an issue for the education sector because current tools are difficult to teach with the lack of an intuitive interface. The effect this has is that it 
is harder to teach new students while using a poor user interface therefore making it harder for the students to learn it. However, an intuitive GUI to help learn 
how the tools work will rectify this issue. 

The Graphical user Interface that is being developed will make pen testing tools more widely available to all skill levels and disabilities. This is because the 
interface will be more intuitive with a colour-blind colour scheme. This intern allows for a more inclusive userbase to access the tools from beginner level. 
As Pen testing is a specialised field, an educational GUI will make it easier to teach the tools in an educational environment. The goal is to inspire many types 
of students into the area of penetration testing. Intern, filling vacant jobs in this field because there is a demand for cyber security due to its importance.
